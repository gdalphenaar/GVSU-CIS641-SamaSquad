# Sama Squad

The goal for this project is to build a Raspberry Pi-controlled temperature and humidity monitor for guitars. This system will allow a user to access a web-based dashboard displaying current and historic guitar climate information on their local network. The user will also be able to customize some settings, including the desired "normal" humidity range and the logging period and frequency of the sensor(s). More information will be added here as project details are hashed out.
