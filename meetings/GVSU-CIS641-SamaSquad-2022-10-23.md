## Meeting minutes

Team name: Sama Squad

Members present: Grant Alphenaar (GA)

Date: Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022

Time: 5PM

Discussion points:

* Got sensor working over wifi (in a preliminary manner)
    * Caveat / potential issue: network credentials need to be semi-hardcoded when the code is loaded onto the board (i.e., no way to change network settings without totally re-uploading code to the board)

Goals for next week (include responsibilities):

* See if there's a way to set up a config file or similar with network credentials (responsibility: GA)
    * Though I suppose having to have them in an external config file isn't the worst, since any user will need to have a compatible sensor and board, along with the capability to load code onto the board anyways
* Keep working on simulated data for experimentation
