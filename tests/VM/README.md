# Testing Virtual Machine

This folder contains a [Vagrantfile](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started) to configure a [Debian](https://app.vagrantup.com/debian/boxes/bullseye64) virtual machine. As much as is possible (while still keeping things simple), this VM is designed to emulate a Raspberry Pi environment.

This VM can be used to test installation before installing on an actual Raspberry Pi.

Clone the repo, then run `/src/scripts/setup.sh`
