# Simulations

This folder contains a Python program and shell script that simulate three sensors:
1. `sensor01`
2. `sensor02`
3. `sensor03`

These simulations publish in the same format as the actual, physical sensors, and can be used to test configurations.

Run `python3 simulate.py -h` for more information
